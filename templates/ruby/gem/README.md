Checkout the repo

```bash
git clone {{dom.repo_info.link}}
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. 

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

```bash
bin/console

Aaa::Bbb::Program.execute()
# => ""
```

`{{dom.application}}` is setup with Guard, run `guard`, this will watch development file changes and run tests automatically, if successful, it will then run rubocop for style quality.

```bash
rake publish
rake clean
```
